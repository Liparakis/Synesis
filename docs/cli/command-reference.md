# Unified CLI Command Reference

The only public application launcher is `synesis`.

Ordinary project commands discover `.synesis` from the current directory. An
advanced `--profile <dir>` override is available on commands that support
isolated process tests and cross-profile experiments. Hook JSON stays on
stdout; diagnostics stay on stderr and hook exit code remains 0 for provider
contract responses.

Provider installation commands are project-local. `synesis version` is safe to
run without a project and reports embedded build metadata. Provider commands
use canonical IDs only.
