# Goal

- Product: Synesis, with Synesis Link as the first implemented transport/session module
- Repository type: modular-monolith Gradle project
- Current phase: SYN-039 is ACTIVE. SYN-038 is DONE at CP-0458, with its Codex App Server lifecycle phase preserved at CP-0447/CP-0448 and its durable project-command extension completed in implementation commit `ad9fdd8`. SYN-037 completed at CP-0415. SYN-036 remains DONE at CP-0407; SYN-014E remains paused; older verification tasks retain their recorded status.
- Networking implementation: authenticated QUIC sessions, bounded control path, application liveness, bounded direct candidate selection, demo-only application request/result exchange, and signed single-use terminal invitations
- Wider Synesis capabilities: out of scope; SYN-038 is the explicitly tasked Codex-only lifecycle slice
- Goal revision: 21
- Status: active
- Goal status: Make two ordinary Synesis-aware coding agents complete one shared repository task unattended through the existing workgroup, review, handoff, validation, integration, cleanup, and diagnostics boundaries. SYN-039 must preserve independent Codex/Claude Code sessions underneath Synesis and must not add a central orchestrator, UI, daemon, Fleet system, or centralized launcher. The prior unattended Todo smoke failure supplied for this activation is the primary failure evidence; its raw run artifact is not present in the checkout and must be captured before implementation claims.
  SYN-038 evidence and its `turn_interrupted_command_remained_active` limitation remain unchanged. SYN-010A's
  required license decision is recorded as AGPL-3.0-only; publication remains
  unperformed pending explicit push authorization and remaining review gates.
- Completion target: Synesis Link v1 criteria in `docs/agent/CONTRACT.md`
- Evidence: SYN-009C release evidence is complete at CP-0110; SYN-010A
  publication audit, current/reachable-history scan, documentation preparation,
  strict Java verification, and repository validators are recorded at CP-0111.
- Evidence: `docs/architecture/zero-touch-agent-collaboration.md`,
  `docs/validation/multi-chat-provider-acceptance.md`,
  `docs/evidence/syn037-real-codex-acceptance-2026-08-03.md`,
  `docs/evidence/syn038-codex-schema-2026-08-03.md`,
  `docs/evidence/syn038-real-codex-acceptance-2026-08-03.md`,
  `docs/evidence/syn038-real-codex-app-server-acceptance-2026-08-03.md`, and
  ADR-0043.
- Exact continuation: run `powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File
  scripts/agent-resume.ps1`, then trace the producer snapshot-publication
  transition for WorkGroup `ed61f1d9-02d8-350b-8188-e27854dc9a21` exposed by
  `docs/evidence/syn039-unattended-todo-review-validation-2026-08-22.md`.
  Implement only that next SYN-039 blocker. Keep `SYN-014E` paused and do not
  create SYN-040 or add prerelease compatibility aliases.
