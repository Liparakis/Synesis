# Current Task

## Identity

- Task ID: SYN-039
- Status: ACTIVE
- Priority: P0
- Activation checkpoint: CP-0459
- Previous completed task: SYN-038 at CP-0458
- Responsible agent: primary implementation engineer
- Related decisions: existing WorkGroup/LaneGrant, snapshot, integration,
  cleanup, Doctor, and provider-boundary decisions; no new ADR is created by
  activation alone

## Objective

Make two ordinary Synesis-aware coding agents complete one shared repository
task unattended through the existing Synesis coordination model. Agent A must
implement, Agent B must review and validate without conflicting write
ownership, rejection must return work to the correct implementer, accepted
work must integrate, and the WorkGroup must close with no unresolved state.

## Activation boundary

- The reviewer-validation and producer-publication slices are implemented and
  under verification; reviewer admission, grant consumption, and the explicit
  owner publication action are now covered.
- The existing independent Codex/Claude Code session model remains underneath
  Synesis. Do not add a central orchestrator, UI, daemon, Fleet system,
  centralized launcher, provider intelligence, or manual relay service.
- SYN-038 remains complete and its prior acceptance evidence and
  `turn_interrupted_command_remained_active` limitation are preserved.

## Evidence and known gap

- Primary failure input: the user-supplied previous unattended Todo smoke test.
- The raw Todo smoke-test artifact was not present in the checkout. The
  reproduction is now captured in
  `docs/evidence/syn039-unattended-todo-baseline-2026-08-22.md`; raw Codex
  JSONL remains in the disposable fixture's `baseline-logs` directory.
- Checked-in supporting evidence is
  `docs/architecture/zero-touch-agent-collaboration.md`, where the two-process
  path is DEMO_ONLY and manually driven, and
  `docs/validation/multi-chat-provider-acceptance.md`, which does not claim
  autonomous end-to-end integration.

## Acceptance target

- Two ordinary Synesis-aware sessions discover and join one durable WorkGroup
  without user file assignment or message relay.
- A reviewer/validator can inspect and validate another agent's completed
  immutable snapshot through a read-only or explicitly delegated review path
  without acquiring the implementer's mutation ownership.
- Validation emits structured accept/reject evidence. Rejection returns
  durable work to the correct implementer with preserved lineage and
  idempotent request handling.
- Accepted work integrates through the existing guarded integration path into
  the final project state without manual intervention.
- Completion closes participants, claims, lane grants, pending requests,
  detached coordination state, and temporary artifacts.
- Final `synesis doctor` is healthy or reports only explicitly accepted
  non-blocking warnings.
- The unattended two-agent Todo experiment passes end to end: Agent A
  implements, Agent B reviews/validates, one rejected result routes back
  correctly, the corrected result is accepted, tests pass, the control
  checkout contains the completed application, the WorkGroup closes, and no
  unresolved coordination state remains.
- The existing ten-tool MCP boundary and provider model remain intact.

## Baseline result

The real two-session reproduction failed. Agent A created WorkGroup
`7c5ab815-5f05-365b-a78b-3478440036af`, implemented the Todo completion
change, passed three focused tests, and published snapshot
`snap_6162f6fd4ff4d51aadb5484609270ab3`. Integration failed with
`integration_failed` / `TESTS_FAILED`. Agent B discovered the WorkGroup but
could not obtain review authorization: `work_group_join` required an unavailable
`grantId`, and no validation request or snapshot view was exposed. The control
checkout stayed at baseline `7a5925f`; post-run Doctor was `DEGRADED` with two
`stale_session_lease` warnings and reconciliation recommended.

The baseline identified the first narrow implementation seam as reviewer
snapshot authorization plus the structured integration evidence mismatch; it
did not authorize a new orchestrator, daemon, UI, Fleet system, or launcher.

## Work completed

Implemented the first two defects and deterministic regressions. A reviewer
can now submit a typed `REVIEW` request after discovering a WorkGroup; owner
acceptance issues a targeted single-use LaneGrant without changing write
ownership. Collaboration status and next-action projections expose WorkGroups,
grants, and immutable snapshots. The integration-check adapter now recognizes
the recorded bounded passing Todo evidence instead of manufacturing
`TESTS_FAILED`.

The prior implementation and rerun evidence is recorded in
`docs/evidence/syn039-unattended-todo-review-validation-2026-08-22.md`. The
producer-publication slice is recorded in
`docs/evidence/syn039-unattended-todo-snapshot-publication-2026-08-22.md`.

## Current failures

The new deterministic projection now tells the owner to publish with the
existing `finish_lane` tool after a reviewer consumes the targeted grant; a
matching published snapshot suppresses that action. Three fresh unattended
Todo reruns are recorded in the new evidence file, but all stopped earlier at
the existing owner REVIEW-admission step. The final fixture exposed
`owner_request_pending`, `respond_coordination`, and request
`4998d76b-fe4b-4d08-b627-103ed21d4122`; the owner did not accept it, so no
grant or snapshot was reached. This is a provider-side protocol-compliance
blocker, not evidence that the new publication action failed.

The serialized root `check` remains incomplete. A focused
`:mcp:test --tests org.synesis.mcp.application.McpServerTest` reproduced the
Git subprocess stall at `McpServerTest.java:181`; worker `24912` was blocked
through `AgentNextActionService` → `RepositoryPrivateStateService` →
`GitProcessRunner` → `ProcessCommandRunner`. It was stopped only after thread
and child-process evidence was captured. Doctor remains `DEGRADED` with the
existing documented warnings.

## Implementation order

1. Reproduce and capture the supplied unattended Todo failure.
2. Implement reviewer admission and the integration evidence fix.
3. Re-run the admitted-review path through the new owner `finish_lane` action;
   if reached, preserve the next lifecycle failure as a bounded blocker.
4. Implement autonomous rejection routing, handoff lineage, and WorkGroup
   cleanup/Doctor closure only as required by evidence.
5. Rerun the same unattended Todo experiment with no babysitting and record
   the complete evidence.

## Immediate next action

Run `powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/agent-resume.ps1`, then
inspect the per-project MCP/session startup path that caused both fresh agents
to receive `workspace_not_ready` before `ensure_session`; reproduce that
readiness state with a deterministic fixture before changing production code.
Do not broaden SYN-039 or create SYN-040.

## CP-0471 owner REVIEW-acceptance slice

The owner-side projection defect is fixed. For a pending REVIEW request,
`get_next_action` now includes the exact request-specific strict
`respond_coordination` payload and WorkGroup/intent/claim-epoch context;
`AgentWorkflowReducer` carries that payload into the existing executable
workflow action. The collaboration service still performs authorization and
replay checks. Deterministic MCP, workspace, coordination, Javadocs,
validator, Go, vet, and diff checks pass. Evidence:
`docs/evidence/syn039-unattended-todo-owner-acceptance-2026-08-22.md`.

The fresh app-managed two-agent rerun did not reach this state: initial
ownership admission returned the existing typed `overlapping_claim` blocker
because another participant already held both Todo paths. It is not a valid
end-to-end result for this slice. Root `check` remains incomplete at the known
Git subprocess stall in `WorkspaceCliTest.setUp:74`; Doctor remains DEGRADED.

Immediate next action: run the exact fresh two-agent Todo acceptance with
isolated initial ownership, then verify autonomous owner acceptance and
preserve the next lifecycle failure. Do not broaden SYN-039 or create SYN-040.

## CP-0472 unattended acceptance result

The fresh two-agent run is recorded in
`docs/evidence/syn039-unattended-todo-workspace-not-ready-2026-08-23.md`.
Both independent Luna High agents stopped at the same typed
`workspace_not_ready` → `ensure_session` recovery projection. No WorkGroup,
claim, request, grant, snapshot, validation, integration, or closure state was
created. The fixture remained at coordination sequence zero with zero tasks and
zero ownerships. This is the first blocker for this run, but it is currently
classified as per-project MCP/session readiness until reproduced
deterministically outside the agent harness. No production behavior was
changed.

## CP-0473 workspace-readiness implementation and rerun

The readiness trace identified that Codex's managed global MCP entry omitted
the initialized project root. `ensure_session` therefore depended on the MCP
process directory when a provider did not send MCP roots. Codex installation
now writes the existing `--project <root>` argument through the explicit-root
configuration path. Fresh provider installation, repeated session ensure, and
two independent bindings are covered by deterministic tests. Commit:
`bea47c4`.

The direct MCP process with the generated project-pinned entry returned
`ready/isolated`. The fresh unattended CP-0473 rerun still stopped before
coordination because the agent harness reported an incompatible/stale MCP
distribution and project-schema-v2 readiness failure. No lifecycle state was
created. Evidence:
`docs/evidence/syn039-workspace-readiness-cp0473-2026-08-23.md`.

## CP-0474 current-bundle unattended acceptance

The fresh acceptance used two independent GPT-5.6 Luna High agents and the
rebuilt Windows platform bundle. Both MCP processes launched the current
`synesis-mcp.exe` with the exact disposable project root. Initialize reported
protocol `2025-06-18`, the catalog contained exactly ten tools, and both agents
reached `ready / isolated`.

The run reached the real lifecycle: Agent B discovered WorkGroup
`33e8329c-fd66-3174-9e3f-f115f6dae550`, autonomously obtained and consumed
REVIEW grant `496f1893-ca32-3939-82a1-24f860dea86a`, and did not take write
ownership. Agent A implemented the Todo operation and passed four pytest tests,
but its projected `PUBLISH` action remained blocked by
`snapshot_publication_required`; repeated `finish_lane` returned
`task_not_ready` / `retry`. No snapshot, validation, integration, or closure
was reached. Evidence:
`docs/evidence/syn039-unattended-todo-cp0474-2026-08-24.md`.

Immediate next action: reproduce the owner-side `PUBLISH` /
`snapshot_publication_required` stop deterministically and trace why the
implementer does not execute the already-projected snapshot-publication path.
Implement only that narrow producer transition if the evidence confirms a
protocol defect. Keep cleanup, Doctor, ownership, integration redesign, the
Git stall, and bootstrap migration failures separate; do not create SYN-040.
